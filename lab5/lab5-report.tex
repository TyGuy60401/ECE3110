\section{Introduction}
Through paper calculation, computer simulation, and physical
measurements we will analyze the DC behavior of three similar 
circuits featuring an NMOS transistor. The first is an NMOS
biased in the saturation region, as well as an NMOS biased in 
the triode region, and finally a diode connected NMOS
transistor.
