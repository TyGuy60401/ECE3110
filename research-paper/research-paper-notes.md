# Research paper notes

CNFETs as opposed to MOSFETS or BJTs.

Chalcogenides?

GaAs materials? GaN materials? Differences to silicon?

Pay special attention to III-V semiconductor materials.

### Why is silicon chosen for computer processors?

What else is silicon used for?

Can something else take it's place?

GaAs is used a substrate for silicon

Consider the purposes of semiconductors besides
integrated circuts
