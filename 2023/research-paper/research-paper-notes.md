CNFETs as opposed to MOSFETS or BJTs.

Chalcogenides?

GaAs materials? GaN materials? Differences to silicon?

Pay special attention to III-V semiconductor materials.

### Why is silicon chosen for computer processors?

What else is silicon used for?

Silicon cannot not emit light or something, so it's 
bad for optoelectronics (bandgap)

Let's do some research about SOA's (semiconductor 
optical amplifiers)

Can something else take it's place?

GaAs is used as a substrate for silicon

Consider the purposes of semiconductors besides
integrated circuts

Decent figure about conductivity of semiconductors.

First reports of semiconductor studies go back to the
19th century, but their behaviors were considered
'anomalous at the time'

Around 1900 was the time that we discovered that light
could be transferred to electricity.

Consider more research for rectifier development.

" It is said that he tested in the region of 30 000
materials, of which some 250 proved to be effective
as rectifiers. Of particular note, Pickard used fused
silicon that he obtained from the Westinghouse Electric
Company and found this material to be the most stable
of the rectifiers he tested. In 1906, Pickard filed
a patent on a silicon crystal detector for radio waves
[12]. Thus, silicon made its entry onto the semiconductor
stage."

Birth of the transistor flushed out the use of vacuum 
tubes for computation devices.

### Important page 434-435

" It was noticed that, when a piece of silicon was
cut from one of the ingots, rectification was observed
[17]. In addition, the diode thus produced showed a
very strong photovoltaic effect, the first time this
had been observed in silicon.  By good fortune, p-type
impurities (boron) and n-type impurities (phosphorus)
had redistributed themselves during solidification
of the silicon, with a sharp boundary between the two
regions.  The silicon had been cut perpendicular to
and including the interface boundary, producing a p–n
junction diode rectifier—serendipity indeed! This controllable
way of forming a junction would give more reliable
diodes than the point contact, cat’s whisker diodes."


Germanium was also being developed alongside 
silicon.

"The germanium sat on a metal plate attached to a voltage
source.  With one gold contact forward biased and the
other reverse biased, power gain was observed and the
transistor effect had been discovered [20].  This event
took place on 16 December 1947"
