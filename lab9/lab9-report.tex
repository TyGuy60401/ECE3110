\section{Introduction}
In this lab we are studying the DC biasing of an NPN
transistor.
% Through paper calculation, computer simulation, and physical measurements we will analyze the DC behavior of three similar circuits featuring an NMOS transistor.
% The first is an NMOS biased in the saturation region,
% transistor.
