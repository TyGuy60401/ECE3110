The first rectifier circuits that were invented relied
on devices that are no longer in use because of their
lack of reliability and relative safety concerns. An
example of such a device is the electrolytic rectifier,
which was made by placing two different metals in an
electrolytic solution such that direct current flowing
one way sees less resistance than in the other direction.
Such a rectifier was unsafe and unreliable because it
was temperature sensitive and some models would not
be able to operate in temperatures as low as 86 degrees
Fahrenheit. An electrolytic rectifier also suffered 
from a breakdown voltage when reverse biased which
limited the number of useful applications for the device.

Other early rectifiers/diodes included the vacuum tube diode.
