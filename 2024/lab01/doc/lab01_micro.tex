\section{Introduction}

In this lab we build a simple circuit utilizing a diode
and a resistor to measure and analyze the performance
of the diode under different condiditions. Before we
take measurements of the circuit, we solve for the voltages
and current through the circuit in a few different ways and
then compare our results. We will test our circuit with
a few different voltages to see how the components respond.
